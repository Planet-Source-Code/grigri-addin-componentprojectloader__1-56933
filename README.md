## ADDIN \-\- ComponentProjectLoader


</div>

### Description

Normally when you open a non-project VB-associated file such as a form (.frm), class module (.cls) or standard module (.bas),

VB creates a new project and adds that component to it. I've never found this functionality useful, and on occasion it's annoying.

This Add-In detects when components are loaded directly, and tries to find the associated project.

If it succeeds, it loads the project and then displays the component you loaded - a much more useful way of doing things!
 
### More Info
 
*EDIT*

A file name compare was case-sensitive, causing some projects to not be recognised. This has been fixed.
